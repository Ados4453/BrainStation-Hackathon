            <p class="content__disc-text">The gif above belongs to one of the most iconic TV shows in history <b>The Simpsons</b>. Their historic for a pluthura of reasons but we're going to highlight one specifically and that is their opening sequence. Every episode begins roughly the same but vareing moments in the sequence are changed to maintain originality like bart writing on the chalk bord and most famously when the family goes to rest on the couch.The Simpsons have kept this ethos of keeping every opener unique for over 30 seasons, it was only a matter of time before others dicided to join in the fun. Here we have created a way to see exactly how <b>Bob's Burgers</b> encourporates this ethos and takes it to new heighs in their own way!</p>
